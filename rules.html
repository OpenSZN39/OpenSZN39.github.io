<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="black"><b><u><a name="Ratings">Ratings:</a></u></b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">-This league currently uses two sets of ratings. We create our own set of ratings for the forwards and defense, and we use <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>LCHV</b></font> ratings for the goalies. The reason we do that is this.....we prefer to use ratings that only rate players who played in the previous season. The problem with that is only around 80-90 goalies play a season, and with 26 teams there simply wouldn't be enough goalies to go around. Because of this we use the goalie ratings from LCHV because they also include goalies who played in the AHL</font>
<hr>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="black"><b><u><a name="Salaries_Contracts">Salaries/Contract Lengths:</a></u></b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- Player salaries were based upon the original ratings package that this league applied and have since changed due to free agency</font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- The minimum salary is <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>$500,000</b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- The maximum salary is <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>$10,000,000</b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- Once the playoffs are <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>over</b></font> and the cup has been won, <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>all players</b></font> will then age <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>1</b></font> birth year and <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>1</b></font> contract year.</font><br>
<br>
<u><FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>Example:</font> Brendan Shanahan -</u></b><br>
In this "current season" Shanahan is <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>34</b></font> with a <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>2</b></font> year contract<br>
At playoffs end he will then be <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>35</b></font> with <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>1</b></font> year reamaining on his contract<br>
<hr>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="black"><b><u><a name="Salary_Cap">Salary Cap:</a></u></b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- The salary cap for the current season <font SIZE=2 color="maroon"><b>(19 - 20)</b></font> is</font> <font SIZE=2 color="maroon"><b>$58,000,000</b></font><br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- The salary cap accounts for <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>BOTH</b></font> pro and farm teams <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>COMBINED</b></font><br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- If the salary cap is exceeded you will have <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>until your next scheduled game</b></font> to bring your team back under the cap by way of trade, player dropping, sending players to the farm. The sim can <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>NOT</b></font> run games when a team that is over cap is playing a game on any schedule day. If you do not make this correction by your next game then I will have no choice but to make it for you, otherwise I can <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>NOT</b></font> run any games at all! This correction may include sending a player to the farm, possibly having to pass through waivers, or unfortunately <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>dropping one of your players</b></font>. Obviously that is not the choice anyone would prefer, however if I have no other options then it will be done. If you do not exceed the cap then you will not be penalized!</font><br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- One week before the day of the trade deadline the salary cap will increase by <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>$5,000,000</b></font>. This will allow playoff contending teams to "bulk" up their rosters (while not so drastically) to make a playoff run. As well as allowing teams to "dump" players in the last years of their contracts for salary purposes and clear room for potential FA's in the offseason</font><br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- The extra <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>$5,000,000</b></font> will remain in effect for the next seasons free agency period. After free agency is over the extra <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>$5,000,000</b></font> will be removed from the league cap</font>
<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- You can view your teams current payroll and available cap room by going to the <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>"Finance"</b></font> page. From there scroll <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>all the way down to the bottom</b></font> of the page where there is a section called <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>"Payroll Central"</b></font>. The <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>"Payroll"</b></font> column shows your teams total payroll, and the <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>"Under Maximum Of"</b></font> column is how much available cap room you have. Please <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>ignore</b></font> the <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>"Current Fund"</b></font> column as it does <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>not apply</b></font>
<hr>
<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="black"><b><u><a name="Retiring_Players">Retiring Players:</a></u></b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- Players will be removed from your team <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>one schedule year</b></font> after they have retired from the NHL. For example, if a player retires on the 75th day of the NHL season he will then be removed from your team <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>after</b></font> games are run on day 75 of <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>our following season</b></font>.
<br><br>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="black"><b><u><a name="Other_Countries">Players Playing In Other Leagues/Countries:</a></u></b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- The ratings package that this league applies only rates players who have played at least one game in the previous NHL season. If you have a player on your team who last season did <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>NOT</b></font> play in the NHL then he will <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>NOT</b></font> be included in the next ratings package.
<br><br>
- If a player who was on your team is not included in the new ratings package then they will be removed from your team and placed on your <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>prospect list</b></font>. Your team still <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>holds the rights</b></font> to these players and if they ever decide to return to the NHL and once again get rated, they will continue with the remaining years and salary of their previous contract.

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="black"><b><u><a name="Dropping_Players">Dropping Players (Contract Buyouts):</a></u></b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- You may drop players (buyout their contracts) from your team at anytime. Dropped players will count <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>35% of the players salary against your teams cap room</b></font> for the <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>remaining</b></font> years on the players contract. When you drop a player please realize that the following 2 things will occur.....<br><br>
1. You will be charged <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>35% of the players salary against your teams cap room</b></font> for the <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>remaining</b></font> years on the players contract.

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">For the most part farm teams are for "entertainment" value. They hold no significant bearing on this league other than to see your young players perform against other teams young players, almost like a prospect league so to speak. 
The more players you have on your farm team, the more productive it will be. If a team that has 20 players on its farm roster is playing a team that only has 6 players on its farm roster, the score might be 15-2.

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">- Any increase in attributes may result in an increase of a players OV, which could put them over the OV farm restriction, thus causing them to be automatically moved from the farm to the pro roster</font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">Bidding on free agents is done through the <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>message board</b></font>. All free agents are broken into the specific category of free agent that they fall under. <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>Before</b></font> free agency starts all of your players will be moved to your pro roster, and all of your players who are under contract will have their salaries totaled, thus equaling your current team payroll. This will then be subtracted from the current league salary cap for the upcoming season, thus establishing your available money to spend during free agency</font><br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">Your available money will be posted in the appropriate section on the message board and will be updated nightly <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>(NOT live)</b></font> to account for the current bids you have on the board. It is up to <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>YOU</b></font> to keep track of have much you have available against how much you have out in bids when bidding during the day. Again like I said, nightly we will go through all of the free agents and eliminate all but the current highest bid and update your available money. However, during each day of free agency it is up to <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>YOU</b></font> to know where you started with available money and how much you have left to bid</font><br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">If you have placed a bid on a player during the day, only to have that offer outbid, then you once again have that money to spend, but <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>YOU</b></font> must keep track of that!</font><br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black"><b><u>Here are some examples:</u></b></font><br>
<br>
<u><FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>Example 1:</b></u><br>

<br>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">If another team then places a higher bid on <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>player A</b></font> then you  have that money back and now have <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>8mil left</b></font> to make bids</font><br>

Another GM places a higher offer on your player. In two days if there are no further bids and the player closes, then you will have the option to match the current offer or take compensation. There is no reason to re-bid on your own player, as you will have the option to match the highest bid once the player closes. The only reason to do so would be to increase the years designated by the previous bidder.<br><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">3. Another GM places <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>THE</b></font> initial bid on your RFA, if in 2 days there are no more bids and the player closes, you will then have the option to match the current offer or take compensation. You will have <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>24-hours</b></font> to make your decision. So if the player closes Wednesday @ 10PM you have until Thursday @ 10PM to inform Gavin of your decision. If you do not then you will lose the player and be given the compensation.<br><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="black">4. You and/or no other GM places a bid on your player. You have until <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>10pm(EST)</b></font> of the last day of free agency to have placed a bid. If on the final day of free agency you have <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>NOT</b></font> placed a bid on your player and free agency has <FONT COLOR="maroon"><b>CLOSED</b></font>, then the player will be placed on the unassigned list @ 75% their current salary, no less than 500k.<br><br>
